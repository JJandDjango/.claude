I am trying to make what is effectively a programming language for prompts
These can remain as .md files but don't necessarily need to be
This is intended to be used with Claude which, to my understanding, has training on XML tags, so markdown with xml tags has been recommended
I would like to be able to use each large language model but the focus is with Claude so that's where the formatting matters
I want to utilize the most up to date formatting, particularly with Skills via the official Anthropic documentation
Major sections of each prompt should be those defined in `/primitives/patterns/agentic-patterns.md`
