# Template: Glossary Document (`{project-name}.glossary.md`)

> **Version:** 2.0.0  
> **Output:** `generated-documentation/{project-name}.glossary.md`  
> **Purpose:** Domain-specific terminology reference for the project.

## Overview

The glossary is a standalone reference document generated from the `glossary` section in `documentation-config.yaml`. Other documents automatically link to this file when using domain-specific terminology.

**Generation condition:** Only generated if `glossary` config section exists and is non-empty.

## Section Details

### Terms (REQUIRED)

Each term from the `glossary` config section becomes an H3 heading with its definition.

**Term heading format:**
- Use exact term as heading (preserves case)
- Heading becomes anchor target for linking

**Definition:**
- Use definition verbatim from config
- Should be 1-3 sentences
- Define the term in the context of this project

**Usage (OPTIONAL):**
- Where the term appears in the codebase
- Helps readers understand scope and context
- Auto-generated by scanning for term occurrences

**Related (OPTIONAL):**
- Links to other glossary terms
- Links to relevant documentation files
- Helps readers navigate related concepts

---

## Linking to Glossary

Other documents link to glossary terms on first occurrence.

**Link format:**
```markdown
Handles [Tenant](../MyProject.glossary.md#tenant) provisioning and lifecycle management.
```

**Anchor format:**
- Lowercase
- Spaces become hyphens
- Example: "Tenant Claim" → `#tenant-claim`

**Path calculation:**
- Use relative path from document to glossary
- Glossary is always at documentation root

**Examples by depth:**
```markdown
// From: generated-documentation/MyProject.docs.md
[Tenant](./MyProject.glossary.md#tenant)

// From: generated-documentation/src/API/Services/UserService.docs.md
[Tenant](../../../MyProject.glossary.md#tenant)
```

## Complete Example

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# documentation-config.yaml
glossary:
  Tenant: "An organization or customer account in the multi-tenant system"
  Claim: "A security assertion about a user's identity or permissions"
  Scope: "A permission boundary defining what actions a token can perform"
```

**Generated glossary:**

```markdown

title: "Glossary"
path: "/"

generator_version: "2.0.0"

# MyProject Glossary

Domain-specific terminology used throughout this codebase.

## Terms

### Claim

A security assertion about a user's identity or permissions.

**Usage:** Used in authentication flows and authorization attributes throughout Controllers.

**Related:** [Tenant](#tenant) | [Scope](#scope) | [AuthClient](./src/API/Services/AuthClient.docs.md)

---

### Scope

A permission boundary defining what actions a token can perform.

**Usage:** Defined in token generation and validated in authorization middleware.

**Related:** [Claim](#claim) | [AuthClient](./src/API/Services/AuthClient.docs.md)

---

### Tenant

An organization or customer account in the multi-tenant system.

**Usage:** Found in `TenantService`, `TenantMiddleware`, and most controller authorization logic.

**Related:** [Claim](#claim) | [TenantService](./src/API/Services/TenantService.docs.md)
```

## Term Ordering

Terms are ordered alphabetically by default. This ensures:
- Consistent ordering across regenerations
- Easy scanning for specific terms
- Predictable anchor locations

---

## Empty Glossary Handling

If `glossary` config is:
- Missing entirely → No glossary document generated
- Present but empty (`glossary: {}`) → No glossary document generated
- Present with terms → Glossary document generated

When no glossary exists:
- Root document omits glossary link in Related Documentation
- INDEX.md omits glossary from Structure
- No glossary linking occurs in other documents
